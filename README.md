## Overview

The Hindi Handwritten OCR is a system that enables the conversion of handwritten Hindi text from images into editable text. It achieves this through the use of a Machine Learning model trained on the Devangari Character Dataset, achieving an accuracy of more than 95%. This project leverages tools like Numpy and OpenCV for image preprocessing and region-of-interest (ROI) detection before passing the data to a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for character recognition.

## Features

- Converts handwritten Hindi text from images into editable text.
- Utilizes a machine learning model trained on the Devangari Character Dataset with an accuracy of more than 95%.
- Preprocesses input images using Numpy and OpenCV to improve model performance.
- Identifies and extracts regions of interest (ROI) within images for efficient character recognition.
- Exposure to technologies such as Tensorflow, Numpy, OpenCV, and CNN for deep learning enthusiasts.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get your project up and running:

### Prerequisites

- Python (3.7+)
- TensorFlow
- Numpy
- OpenCV

You can install the required Python packages using `pip`:

```shell
pip install tensorflow numpy opencv-python
```

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/hindi-handwritten-ocr.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```shell
   cd hindi-handwritten-ocr
   ```

3. Run the OCR system:

   ```shell
   python ocr.py
   ```

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples on how to use your OCR system. You can include code snippets or usage scenarios to guide users effectively.

```python
# Example code for using the OCR system
import ocr

image_path = "path/to/your/hindi/image.jpg"
result = ocr.recognize_text(image_path)
print("Recognized Text:", result)
```

```
